# DXF utility
As dxf and dwg files pass through multiple workers, they end up containing meaningless layers and blocks, which makes the document very heavy.

You can find and remove all unused layers and blocks in the drawing, and set the Korean font as the system default font.
## Tools
  - dxf_layer.py : remove unused layer
  - dxf_block : remove unused block
  - dxf_font : change style font
  - dxf_malgum : change TEXT, MTEXT font to malgum.ttf
